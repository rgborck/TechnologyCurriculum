TechnologyCurriculum
====================

This is a STEM supplement for a school curriculum. The reason I am developing this curriculum is because I believe teaching technology at a young age can help a child learn and see possibilities for our future and learn not only how to solve problems, but how to identify problems others may not even perceive, and what types of problems can be solved (with today's technology). I also believe that teaching technology to children will give children the edge to succeed in a technologically complex world.

Curriculum Goals
================
Hopefully anyone with a desire to teach will have all the information needed to teach each of these sections. For any teachers, please complete the exercises _BEFORE_ assigning them to your students to ensure success in teaching the children. If something is not clearly documented in the process, please post an issue here on the github repo, I will do my best to answer them as quickly as possible.
